    A few months ago, I noticed my nails were looking dull, brittle, and kept peeling. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I tried everything — cuticle oils, biotin gummies, even expensive salon gels. 
    But nothing seemed to work long-term.

 <b>That’s when I stumbled across a natural nail serum that — honestly — sounded too good to be true…</b>
  <h2>Why Nail Health Gets Worse in Summer (And What to Do About It)</h2>
  <p>
    Many of us don’t realize how much our daily routines harm our nails — constant moisture, closed shoes, 
    polish remover, and even the wrong soaps can weaken the nail bed.<br>
    <div class="imp">On top of that, things like hidden fungus or lack of certain nutrients (like Vitamin E or collagen) can silently damage nails over time.</div>

  <h2>What I Tried Instead: A Natural Serum That Targets Fungus + Weak Nails</h2>
  <p>
    After reading dozens of reviews and learning more about ingredients like witch hazel, lemon peel extract, and hyaluronic acid, I gave this formula a try.<br>
  </p>
  <b>It's called Metanail Complex, and here's why it caught my attention…</b>
